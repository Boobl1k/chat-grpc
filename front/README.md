You need to install:
* [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.20.3)
(for windows just unpack the archive in your Program files and add /bin directory to PATH)
* [protoc-gen-grpc-web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/releases/tag/1.4.2)
(windows: create a directory in Program files, paste exe into in and add this dir to PATH)

Start:
### `npm run start`
it will automatically build the grpc files (now only for windows)
